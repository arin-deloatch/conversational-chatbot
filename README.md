# Conversational Chatbot

This repository contains the final project for Natural Language Processing and Generative AI (AAI-520), where our team designed and implemented a generative-based chatbot using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

## Project Goal
The aim of this project is to build a chatbot capable of multi-turn conversations, adapting to context, and handling a wide range of topics. The final product includes a web or app interface where users can interact with the chatbot.

## Key Components:
**Research Phase**:
- Studied architectures such as Seq2Seq, Transformers, and GPT.
- Explored key challenges like context management and query ambiguity.
  
**Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
- Utilized datasets like Cornell Movie Dialogs, Stanford QA, or Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus.
- Preprocessed the data (tokenization, context management, etc.).

**Model Design & Training**:
- Built and trained models based on deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
- Implemented or adapted Transformer-based models for chatbot training.

**Evaluation**:
- Used evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
